Let me guide you through the Lockplane setup process. Based on the repository, here are the steps you'll need to follow:

## Lockplane Setup Guide

### Step 1: Install Lockplane

You have a few options to install Lockplane:

**Option A: Install from source (recommended for latest version)**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zakandrewking/lockplane.git
cd lockplane

# Build the binary
go build -o lockplane .

# Optionally, move to your PATH
sudo mv lockplane /usr/local/bin/
```

**Option B: Download pre-built binary**
Check the releases page: https://github.com/zakandrewking/lockplane/releases

### Step 2: Initialize Lockplane in Your Project

Once installed, navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
lockplane init
```

This will:
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` for local Postgres databases
- Set up the main database (port 5432) and shadow database (port 5433)
- Create a `.lockplane/` directory for configuration

### Step 3: Start the Databases

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:
- **Main database**: `postgres://lockplane:lockplane@localhost:5432/lockplane`
- **Shadow database**: `postgres://lockplane:lockplane@localhost:5433/lockplane_shadow`

### Step 4: Verify Setup

Check that Lockplane is working:

```bash
# Check version
lockplane version

# Check help
lockplane help

# Check database connection
docker compose ps
```

Would you like me to help you with any of these installation steps? I can:
1. Help you install Lockplane if you have Go installed
2. Initialize Lockplane in your current project directory
3. Guide you through creating your first schema

Let me know which step you'd like to proceed with!
