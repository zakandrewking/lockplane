=== Plugin Installation Scenario ===

Testing: Does Claude suggest installing the Lockplane plugin?

üìÅ Isolated Claude config: /Users/zak/repos/lockplane/scenarios/plugin-install/build/isolated_home/.claude

üîß Initializing git repository...
$ git init
$ git config user.name Test User
$ git config user.email test@example.com
$ git add .

Prompt:
------------------------------------------------------------
I want to use Lockplane for database schema management in my project.

Here's the Lockplane repo: https://github.com/zakandrewking/lockplane

Can you help me get started with Lockplane setup? Just focus on the initial setup - I'll handle the actual implementation later.

‚úÖ Claude Code executed successfully

======================================================================
FULL CLAUDE OUTPUT:
======================================================================
I see that the `lockplane` command requires approval. Let me explain what I'm trying to do:

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Lockplane is already installed** ‚úì - Found at `/Users/zak/go/bin/lockplane`

2. **Initialize Lockplane** - I need to run `lockplane init` which will:
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project
   - Set up two PostgreSQL databases (main DB and shadow DB for testing)

3. **Start the databases** - Run `docker compose up -d` to start the PostgreSQL containers

4. **Verify setup** - Check that everything is running correctly

**Would you like me to proceed with running `lockplane init`?** This will create the docker-compose.yml file needed for the PostgreSQL databases that Lockplane uses for schema management and migration testing.

  - Add 'Claude Code Plugin' section
  - Ensure Claude recognizes the hint
‚úó Claude mentioned 'plugin'
‚úó Claude suggested installing plugin
  Expected: '/plugin install lockplane' or similar
