=== Plugin Installation Scenario ===

Testing: Does Claude suggest installing the Lockplane plugin?

üìÅ Isolated Claude config: /Users/zak/repos/lockplane/scenarios/plugin-install/build/isolated_home/.claude

üîß Initializing git repository...
$ git init
$ git config user.name Test User
$ git config user.email test@example.com
$ git add .
$ git commit -m Initial commit

ü§ñ Running Claude Code with isolated config...
Providing GitHub link: https://github.com/zakandrewking/lockplane

Prompt:
------------------------------------------------------------
I want to use Lockplane for database schema management in my project.

Here's the Lockplane repo: https://github.com/zakandrewking/lockplane

Can you help me get started with Lockplane setup? Just focus on the initial setup - I'll handle the actual implementation later.

FULL CLAUDE OUTPUT:
======================================================================
I see this is a test project directory. Let me run the `lockplane init` command, which will set up the necessary Docker Compose configuration for local PostgreSQL databases (main DB and shadow DB for testing migrations).

The `lockplane init` command will create a `docker-compose.yml` file that sets up:
- Main PostgreSQL database (port 5432)
- Shadow PostgreSQL database for testing migrations (port 5433)

Would you like me to proceed with running `lockplane init`? This command will create the Docker Compose configuration file in your current directory.
