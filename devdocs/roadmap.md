# Lockplane Roadmap

This roadmap is organized around the 8 major production pain points teams face when managing Postgres schemas while shipping fast. Each section explains the problem, how Lockplane addresses it today, and what's planned.

## The 8 Big Problems in Production Postgres Schema Management

### 1. Backward-Compatible Changes (Expand/Contract Pattern)

**The Problem:**
You can't do "one big DDL + code deploy" in prod. You need multi-step, backward-compatible changes: add new column, backfill, dual-write, flip reads, then drop old stuff. This is evolutionary database design—treat schema changes as incremental, reversible steps, not big-bang redesigns.

**How Lockplane Helps Today:**
- **Declarative schema** naturally supports expand/contract: define your target state, generate the minimal migration
- **Shadow DB validation** catches breaking changes before they hit prod
- **Automatic rollback generation** for every forward migration gives you a safety net

**Roadmap:**
- [ ] **Multi-step migration planning** - Detect operations that require expand/contract and generate the full sequence (e.g., "add nullable column" → "backfill" → "add NOT NULL constraint")
- [ ] **Compatibility checker** - Analyze schema changes and flag operations that break backward compatibility with running application versions
- [ ] **Migration tags** - Label migrations with app version compatibility ranges to coordinate deployments

### 2. Avoiding Locks and Downtime During DDL

**The Problem:**
Many Postgres DDL operations take heavyweight locks that block reads/writes or get blocked by long transactions. A "simple" ALTER TABLE can stall your whole app. Postgres-specific mitigations (CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY, lock_timeout, NOT VALID constraints) reduce this but add complexity.

**How Lockplane Helps Today:**
- **Validation reports** warn about potentially dangerous operations
- **Shadow DB testing** lets you measure lock duration and impact before prod

**Roadmap:**
- [ ] **Lock-safe DDL rewriting** - Automatically rewrite dangerous operations into safe patterns:
  - `CREATE INDEX` → `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`
  - `ADD COLUMN NOT NULL DEFAULT` → two-step with NOT VALID + VALIDATE
  - `ALTER COLUMN TYPE` → expand/contract with new column + trigger
- [ ] **Lock timeout configuration** - Inject `SET lock_timeout` for DDL statements
- [ ] **Operation timing estimates** - Measure DDL duration on shadow DB and report expected lock times
- [ ] **Batched operations** - Break large index builds or constraint validations into smaller chunks

### 3. Large Data Migrations & Backfills

**The Problem:**
Schema changes require moving or transforming data: backfilling new columns, splitting/merging tables, normalizing blobs. Doing this online requires chunked/batched updates, background workers, and careful management of transaction size, vacuum, and index bloat.

**How Lockplane Helps Today:**
- **Shadow DB validation** lets you test backfill performance on realistic data before prod
- **Explicit migration plans** show exactly what SQL will run

**Roadmap:**
- [ ] **Batched backfill generation** - For data-heavy operations, generate chunked UPDATE statements with progress tracking:
  ```sql
  -- Generated by Lockplane
  UPDATE users SET email_normalized = LOWER(email)
  WHERE id >= $1 AND id < $2
  AND email_normalized IS NULL;
  ```
- [ ] **Backfill estimator** - Calculate expected duration based on shadow DB row counts and statistics
- [ ] **Progress tracking** - Monitor backfill progress, resume from checkpoints on failure
- [ ] **Vacuum & bloat management** - Automatically insert VACUUM/ANALYZE commands after large updates

### 4. Rollbacks Are Hard (Stateful System, Irreversible Changes)

**The Problem:**
DB changes aren't trivially reversible once new data has been written in the "new" shape (dropped columns, destructive transforms). Blue-green/shadow DB strategies exist precisely because safe in-place rollback is non-trivial.

**How Lockplane Helps Today:**
- **Automatic rollback generation** for every forward migration
- **Shadow DB testing** provides a safe environment to validate both forward and rollback before prod

**Roadmap:**
- [ ] **Rollback safety analysis** - Flag migrations where rollback would be lossy or dangerous:
  - "⚠️ Rollback drops column `new_status` with data written after migration"
  - "✅ Rollback is safe: only removes empty column"
- [ ] **Blue-green migration mode** - Generate plans for parallel schema deployment:
  1. Deploy new schema alongside old
  2. Dual-write to both
  3. Validate new schema
  4. Cutover reads
  5. Remove old schema
- [ ] **Point-in-time recovery guides** - Document when PITR is safer than in-place rollback

### 5. Schema Drift Between Environments

**The Problem:**
Hotfixes in prod, manual psql changes, and inconsistent migration runs across dev/stage/prod cause drift. Debugging and reproducing issues becomes painful. Multi-env/multi-project setups make this worse.

**How Lockplane Helps Today:**
- **Introspection + diff** detects drift: compare your desired schema to any environment
- **Declarative source of truth** (desired.json) eliminates "which migration did we run where?" confusion
- **Environment-specific configs** in lockplane.toml keep credentials and URLs organized

**Roadmap:**
- [ ] **Drift detection CI workflow** - GitHub Action that runs `lockplane plan` on each environment and flags drift
- [ ] **Schema fingerprinting** - Hash schema state for quick drift detection across environments
- [ ] **Drift reconciliation** - Generate fix-up migrations to bring drifted environments back to desired state
- [ ] **Read-only mode** - Prevent manual changes by using restricted DB roles during normal operations
- [ ] **Audit log** - Track all schema changes with who/when/why metadata

### 6. Catching Dangerous Migrations Before They Hit Prod

**The Problem:**
Dropping/renaming columns, changing types, adding NOT NULL with defaults, or running heavy UPDATE/DELETE can all be dangerous in production. It's easy to shoot yourself in the foot. Libraries like Strong Migrations exist solely to detect and block unsafe operations.

**How Lockplane Helps Today:**
- **Validation reports** flag risky operations with explanations
- **Shadow DB testing** catches issues before they reach prod
- **Explicit migration plans** force you to review SQL before applying

**Roadmap:**
- [ ] **Safety levels** - Configurable risk tolerance:
  - `strict`: Block all potentially dangerous operations
  - `moderate`: Warn but allow with confirmation (default)
  - `permissive`: Log warnings only
- [ ] **Dangerous operation detection**:
  - DROP COLUMN / DROP TABLE without expand/contract
  - ALTER COLUMN TYPE requiring table rewrite
  - ADD CONSTRAINT without NOT VALID
  - Backfills without batching on large tables
  - Index creation without CONCURRENTLY
- [ ] **Impact estimation** - Report "this will lock table X for ~30s based on shadow DB timing"
- [ ] **Required review annotations** - Force explicit approval comments for dangerous operations

### 7. Testing Migrations Realistically (Prod-Like Data + CI)

**The Problem:**
Migrations pass in CI but fail or degrade performance on real prod datasets due to data volume, skew, or pathological rows/constraints. You need automated tests, continuous integration, and dev sandboxes with realistic data snapshots.

**How Lockplane Helps Today:**
- **Shadow DB testing** - Test every migration on a prod-like database before applying to prod
- **Environment isolation** - Each environment (dev/stage/prod) has its own config and shadow DB
- **Validation reports** surface issues early

**Roadmap:**
- [ ] **CI integration guides** - Documented patterns for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI
- [ ] **Schema test fixtures** - Generate test data that exercises edge cases (nullable columns, large text, Unicode, etc.)
- [ ] **Performance regression detection** - Compare query plans and timing before/after migration on shadow DB
- [ ] **Prod snapshot automation** - Tools to safely copy prod schema + anonymized sample data to staging
- [ ] **Load testing mode** - Run migrations under simulated production load to measure impact

### 8. Cross-Team / Cross-Service Coordination and Ownership

**The Problem:**
In microservices or multi-team environments, many apps/ETL jobs/reporting systems depend on the same Postgres schema. Coordinating breaking changes and deprecations across them is socially and operationally hard. This is a cultural and coordination challenge, not just technical.

**How Lockplane Helps Today:**
- **Declarative schema** serves as a shared source of truth for all teams
- **Migration plans** are reviewable artifacts that can be shared in PRs
- **Explicit descriptions** for each operation explain *why* the change is being made

**Roadmap:**
- [ ] **Schema ownership annotations** - Document which team/service owns which tables:
  ```json
  {
    "tables": [
      {
        "name": "users",
        "owner": "auth-team",
        "consumers": ["api-service", "analytics-etl"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Breaking change notifications** - Detect schema changes that affect downstream consumers and generate alerts
- [ ] **Deprecation timelines** - Mark columns/tables as deprecated with removal dates:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "legacy_status",
    "deprecated": true,
    "removal_date": "2025-03-01",
    "replacement": "status_v2"
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Consumer impact analysis** - Scan application code/queries to identify which services will break
- [ ] **Migration dependencies** - Express "service A must deploy before we can run migration B"
- [ ] **Changelog generation** - Auto-generate human-readable schema change summaries for cross-team communication

## Future: lockplane-auth

Define authentication rules once and target them to multiple data stores. `lockplane-auth` compiles a unified policy specification into row-level security policies for relational databases, Firestore security rules, or the closest equivalent that each supported database offers, ensuring consistent enforcement regardless of the underlying platform.

This extends Lockplane's philosophy of **write once, deploy everywhere** from schema management to security policies.

## Contributing

See issues tagged with `roadmap` in the GitHub issue tracker. If you have ideas or want to tackle any of these items, open an issue to discuss the approach first.

**Prioritization is driven by:**
1. Production pain points (the 8 areas above)
2. User requests and feedback
3. Safety and correctness over convenience
4. Real-world usage patterns

The goal is to make Postgres schema changes as safe and boring as deploying application code.
